# Web Technology Projects

This repository contains projects developed as part of the **Web Technology** course during my college studies. The projects cover fundamental concepts of web development, including **HTML, CSS (Inline, Internal, and External), and JavaScript**.

## Projects

### 1. Static E-Commerce Website
A simple static e-commerce website demonstrating the use of different CSS styling methods.

#### **Features:**
- **HTML Structure**: Header, Navigation, Product Section, About Section, and Contact Section.
- **Styling Methods**:
  - **Inline CSS**: Directly applied to elements (e.g., title color).
  - **Internal CSS**: Defined inside the `<style>` tag within the HTML file.
  - **External CSS**: Stored in a separate `styles.css` file for better organization.
- **Basic Form Handling**: A contact form for user inquiries.

#### **File Structure:**
```
ðŸ“‚ Web-Technology-Projects/
   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ index.html
   â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ styles.css
```

#### **Preview:**
To run the project, simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
